Deploying this Quick Start with default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/vpc-architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two to four Availability Zones.

* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
The VPC provides Domain Name System (DNS) resolution.

* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
** Dedicated custom network access control lists (ACLs) for each Availability Zone.
** A single routing table (not shown) because the public subnets all use the same internet gateway as the sole route to communicate with the internet.

* In the private subnets:
** Dedicated custom network ACLs for each Availability Zone.
** An independent routing table (not shown) for each private subnet configured to control the flow of traffic within and outside the VPC.
** Spare capacity for adding subnets to support your environment as it grows.

* A VPC gateway endpoint for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
This endpoint provides a secure, reliable connection to Amazon S3 without requiring an internet gateway, NAT gateway, or virtual private gateway.
The endpoint uses the default endpoint policy, which gives any user or service within the VPC full access to Amazon S3 resources.
This policy supplements any IAM user policies or S3 bucket policies that you may have in place.
With this endpoint, you can access S3 resources from within the VPC created by the Quick Start.
This endpoint is valid only for the AWS Region in which you launch the Quick Start.

NOTE: Default subnet sizes are based on a typical deployment. You can reconfigure the sizes, as discussed in the link:#_predeployment_steps[Predeployment steps] section.
